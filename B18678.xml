            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF THE JOYNERS Company, AGAINST <hi>The Importation of Manufactured</hi> CABINET-WORK <hi>from the</hi> EAST-INDIES.</head>
            <p>WHEREAS great Numbers of Artificers, Members of the said Company, have been bred up in the said Art or Mystery of making Cabinets, Scrutores, Tables, Chests, and all other sorts of CABINET-WORK in <hi>England,</hi> in which of late Years they have arrived to so great a Perfection, as exceeds all <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT several Merchants, and others, Trading to the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> and to several Ports and Places thereabouts, have procured to be made in <hi>London,</hi> of late Years, and sent over to the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> Patterns and Models of all sorts of Cabinet Goods; an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> have Yearly return'd from thence such great Quantities of Cabinet-Wares, Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured there, after the <hi>English</hi> Fashion, by our Models, that the said Trade in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is in great Danger of being utterly Ruined, being ingross'd by the said Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and others, that Trade to and from those Parts, to so great a Degree, that they not only supply these Kingdoms with such Commodities, so Imported, but also spoil the EXPORTATION of the said <hi>Joyners</hi> and <hi>Cabinet-Makers</hi> Work to Foreign Parts, so that their Journey-men and Apprentices, in a manner, will be useless; which, if not timely prevented, will Reduce the said <hi>Joyners, Cabinet-Makers,</hi> and Thousands of other Poor Artificers depending on them, as the <hi>Carvers, Turners, Copper-Smiths, Glew-makers, Sawyers,</hi> &amp;c. to a deplorable Condition, who must perish for want of Work, or be maintain'd by their several Parishes.</p>
            <p>AND in lieu of abundance of Foreign Commodities, which the said <hi>Joyners</hi> and <hi>Cabinet-Makers</hi> are obliged to use in their Trade, the <hi>English</hi> Woollen Manufactures were Exported, so that the Kingdom in general were Gainers thereby.</p>
            <p>AND the Youth of this Nation, that now are, and daily come to Handycraft Trades, will be under the like Misfortune, if, when their Trades are brought to Perfection, their Models are carried to <hi>India,</hi> and Manufactured there.</p>
            <p>THE following Goods, Manufactured in <hi>India,</hi> have been Imported within these Four Years, <hi>viz.</hi> Two Hundred forty four Cabinets, Six Thousand five hundred eighty two Tea-Tables, Four hundred twenty eight Chests, Seventy Trunks, Fifty two Screens, Five hundred eighty nine Looking-Glass Frames, Six hundred fifty five Tops for Stands, Eight hundred eighteen Lacquer'd Boards, Five hundred ninety seven Sconces, and Four thousand one hundred twenty Dressing, Comb, and Powder Boxes.</p>
            <p>Besides several Sales lately made, in which were great Quantities of the said CABI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NET-WORK; as also in other Sales daily expected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore 'tis hoped the Wisdom of this Honourable House will Interpose for the Relief of these poor Artificers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
